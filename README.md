# ServiceNowEvaluator-mixins

Some mixins for ServiceNowEvaluator. Mainly because the evaluator is less of an evaluator
and more of a session manager, but I don't want to modify it.

## Usage

Just require the file you want and it will extend the ServiceNowEvaluator prototype automatically.

```js
require('@thproxy/servicenowevaluator-mixins/update-sets');
```

Each directory has a README with example usage for new methods.
